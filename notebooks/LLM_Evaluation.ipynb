            "  - actual output: Bipolar mood disorder, also known as bipolar disorder, is a mental illness characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). The symptoms and characteristics of bipolar mood disorder can vary widely from person to person, but some common signs and symptoms include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Manic episodes: During a manic episode, a person may experience an elevated or irritable mood, increased energy and activity, racing thoughts, rapid speech, decreased need for sleep, and impulsive or reckless behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Depressive episodes: During a depressive episode, a person may experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, and guilt, as well as changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Mixed episodes: Some people with bipolar disorder may experience symptoms of both mania and depression at the same time, leading to a combination of high energy and low mood.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Cyclothymic disorder: This is a milder form of bipolar disorder characterized by episodes of hypomania and mild depression that last for at least two years.\n",

            "6. Impairment in functioning: Bipolar disorder can significantly impact a person's ability to function in daily life, including work, school, and relationships.\n",

            "It's important to note that bipolar disorder is a complex and multifaceted condition, and individuals may experience a wide range of symptoms and severity. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n",
