            "1. **Listen Actively and Respectfully**  \n",
            "   Show genuine interest in their thoughts and feelings. Use active listening techniques such as nodding, summarizing what they say, and asking open-ended questions. This demonstrates that you value their perspective, even if you don’t agree.\n",

            "2. **Acknowledge Their Feelings and Reasoning**  \n",
            "   Validate their emotions and the logic behind their opinions. For example, say, “I see why you feel that way,” or “That’s an interesting point.” This helps them feel heard and respected.\n",

            "4. **Encourage Critical Thinking**  \n",
            "   Instead of simply telling them what you think, ask questions that encourage them to reflect on their opinions and consider alternative viewpoints. For example, “What do you think might happen if…?” or “Have you thought about…?”\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Set Boundaries While Offering Choices**  \n",
            "   Promote autonomy by allowing them to make decisions within safe and reasonable limits. For instance, offer options rather than directives, which helps them practice decision-making skills.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Model Respectful Disagreement**  \n",
            "   Demonstrate how to disagree respectfully by maintaining a calm tone, avoiding personal attacks, and focusing on ideas rather than character.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Reinforce Their Competence and Growth**  \n",
            "   Highlight instances where they’ve made good decisions or shown maturity. This builds confidence and encourages continued autonomy.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Be Patient and Open to Ongoing Dialogue**  \n",

            "\n",

It also includes receiving visitors at reasonable times. An authorised psychiatrist can restrict an inpatient’s right to communicate only if it is reasonably necessary to protect their health, safety and wellbeing or that of another person. There are certain people that an authorised psychiatrist cannot restrict an inpatient from communicating with. The right to communicate\\n\\nInpatients receiving compulsory assessment or treatment have a right to communicate lawfully with any person. This includes for the purpose of seeking legal advice or representation or seeking the assistance of an advocate. Communication includes making or receiving phone calls, sending or receiving letters; communicating via electronic means; and receiving visitors at reasonable times. Staff of a designated mental health service must ensure reasonable steps are taken to assist an inpatient to communicate. Restricting the right to communicate\\n\\nAn authorised psychiatrist can make a written direction to restrict an inpatient’s right to communicate if they are satisfied that it is reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and wellbeing, of the inpatient or of another person. Any such restriction must be the least restrictive possible in the circumstances to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of the inpatient or of another person.

The authorised psychiatrist must also ensure reasonable steps are taken to provide that information to:\\n\\nthe inpatient’s:\\n\\nnominated support person, if they have one\\n\\nguardian, if they have one\\n\\ncarer, if the restriction will directly affect the carer and the care relationship\\n\\nparent, if the inpatient is under the age of 16\\n\\nthe Secretary of the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing if that Secretary has parental responsibility for the inpatient under a relevant child protection order\\n\\nthe non-legal mental health advocacy service provider.

Restriction to be regularly reviewed\\n\\nThe authorised psychiatrist must regularly review the decision to restrict an inpatient’s right to communicate and must end the restriction immediately if satisfied that it is no longer necessary. Key changes from Mental Health Act 2014\\n\\nThese provisions remain largely unchanged from the Mental Health Act 2014. The non-legal mental health advocacy service provider and mental health advocates have been added to the list of people/organisations with whom an inpatient cannot be restricted from communicating.

This demonstrates that you value their perspective, even if you don’t agree.\\n\\n2. **Acknowledge Their Feelings and Reasoning**  \\n   Validate their emotions and the logic behind their opinions. For example, say, “I see why you feel that way,” or “That’s an interesting point.” This helps them feel heard and respected.\\n\\n3. **Express Your Perspective Calmly and Clearly**  \\n   Share your views without dismissing theirs. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and reasoning, such as, “I’m concerned about this because…” rather than “You’re wrong.”\\n\\n4. **Encourage Critical Thinking**  \\n   Instead of simply telling them what you think, ask questions that encourage them to reflect on their opinions and consider alternative viewpoints. For example, “What do you think might happen if…?” or “Have you thought about…?”\\n\\n5. **Set Boundaries While Offering Choices**  \\n   Promote autonomy by allowing them to make decisions within safe and reasonable limits. For instance, offer options rather than directives, which helps them practice decision-making skills.\\n\\n6. **Model Respectful Disagreement**  \\n   Demonstrate how to disagree respectfully by maintaining a calm tone, avoiding personal attacks, and focusing on ideas rather than character.\\n\\n7. **Reinforce Their Competence and Growth**  \\n   Highlight instances where they’ve made good decisions or shown maturity. This builds confidence and encourages continued autonomy.\\n\\n8. **Be Patient and Open to Ongoing Dialogue**  \\n   Recognize that developing autonomy and mutual understanding is a process. Keep communication lines open and revisit discussions as needed.\\n\\nBy combining these approaches, you create an environment where adolescents feel empowered to express themselves and develop independence, while also understanding and respecting differing viewpoints.', expected_output='Promote adolescent autonomy by respecting their opinions even when you disagree and being responsive to their efforts to include you in decision-making.
