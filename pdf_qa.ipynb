            " docs returned is :: 2 whose contents are Umbriel () is the third-largest moon of Uranus. It was discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell at the same time as neighboring moon Ariel. It was named after a character in Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts, but the presence of canyons suggests early internal processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\n",
            "Covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second-most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all regular moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation. Umbriel has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\n",
            "\n",
            "== Orbit ==\n",
            "Umbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about 266,000 km (165,000 mi), being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1 Earth days, coincident with its rotational period, making it a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).

              "{'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"Umbriel () is the third-largest moon of Uranus. It was discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell at the same time as neighboring moon Ariel. It was named after a character in Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts, but the presence of canyons suggests early internal processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\\nCovered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second-most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all regular moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation. Umbriel has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\\n\\n== Orbit ==\\nUmbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about 266,000 km (165,000 mi), being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1 Earth days, coincident with its rotational period, making it a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.\\nBecause Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, Umbriel and the other moons are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle.

This enterprise  has proceeded so rapidly-with so \\nlittle outside commentary-that its dimensions and implications are hardly \\nunderstood at all. \\n    Biotechnology promises the greate st revolution in human history. By \\nthe end of this decade, it will ha ve outdistanced atomic power and \\ncomputers in its effect on our ever yday lives. In the words of one \\nobserver, \"Biotechnology is going to  transform every aspect of human \\nlife: our medical care, our food, our health, our entertainment, our very \\nbodies. Nothing will ever be the same ag ain. It\\'s literally going to change \\nthe face of the planet.\" \\n    But the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects \\nfrom past scientific transformations. \\n    First, it is broad-based. Amer ica entered the atomic age through the \\nwork of a single research institut ion, at Los Alamos. It entered the \\ncomputer age through the efforts of about a dozen companies. But \\nbiotecbnology research is now carried out in more than two thousand \\nlaboratories in America alone. Five  hundred corporations spend five \\nbillion dollars a year on this technology. \\n    Second, much of the research is  thoughtless or frivolous. Efforts to \\nengineer paler trout for better visibili ty in the stream, square trees for \\neasier lumbering, and injectable scent cells so you\\'ll always smell of your \\nfavorite perfume may seem like a jo ke, but they are not. Indeed, the \\nfact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally \\nsubject to the vagaries of fashio n, such as cosmetics and leisure \\nactivities, heightens concern about th e whimsical use of this powerful \\nnew technology. \\n    Third, the work is uncontrolled. No one supervises it. No federal laws \\nregulate it. There is no coherent government policy, in America or \\nanywhere else in the world. And be cause the products of biotechnology'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/290b41329dfe790093b4b8fae7d81a93ea1cb17b0c164399c6e9c77dbfdf60c9/JurassicPark.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=\"range from drugs to farm crops to arti ficial snow, an intelligent policy is \\ndifficult. \\n    But most disturbing is the fa ct that no watchdogs are found among \\nscientists themselves. It is remark able that nearly every scientist in \\ngenetics research is also engaged in the commerce of biotechnology. \\nThere are no detached observers. Everybody has a stake. \\n \\nThe commercialization of molecular bi ology is the most stunning ethical \\nevent in the history of science, an d it has happened with astonishing \\nspeed. For four hundred years since Galileo, science has always \\nproceeded as a free and open inquiry  into the workings of nature. \\nScientists have always ignored nati onal boundaries, holding themselves \\nabove the transitory concerns of poli tics and even wars . Scientists have \\nalways rebelled against secrecy in research, and have even frowned on \\nthe idea of patenting their discoverie s, seeing themselves as working to \\nthe benefit of all mankind. And for ma ny generations, the discoveries of \\nscientists did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality. \\n    When, in 1953, two young researchers in England, James Watson and \\nFrancis Crick, deciphered the structur e of DNA, their work was bailed \\nas a triumph of the human spirit, of the centuries-old quest to \\nunderstand the universe in a scientific way. It was confidently expected \\nthat their discovery would be selfle ssly extended to the greater benefit \\nof mankind. \\n    Yet that did not happen. Thirty years later, nearly all of Watson and \\nCrick's scientific colleagues were enga ged in another sort of enterprise \\nentirely. Research in molecular geneti cs had become a vast, multibillion \\ndollar commercial undertaking, and its origins can be traced not to 1953 \\nbut to April 1976. \\n    That was the date of a now famo us meeting, in which Robert Swanson, \\na venture capitalist, approached Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the \\nUniversity of California. The two men agreed to found a commercial \\ncompany to exploit Boyer's gene-splic ing techniques. Their new company, \\nGenentech, quickly became the larg est and most successful of the \\ngenetic engineering start-ups.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/290b41329dfe790093b4b8fae7d81a93ea1cb17b0c164399c6e9c77dbfdf60c9/JurassicPark.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=\"Suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich. New \\ncompanies were announced almost w eekly, and scientists flocked to \\nexploit genetic research. By 1986, at least 362 scientists, including 64 in \\nthe National Academy, sat on the advi sory boards of biotech firms. The \\nnumber of those who held equity po sitions or consultancies was several \\ntimes greater. \\n    It is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude \\nactually was. In the past, pure sc ientists took a snobbish view of \\nbusiness. They saw the pu rsuit of money as intellectually uninteresting, \\nsuited only to shopkeepers. And to do research for industry, even at the \\nprestigious Bell or IBM labs, was on ly for those who couldn't get a \\nuniversity appointment. Thus the a ttitude of pure scientists was \\nfundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists, and to \\nindustry in general. Their long-s tanding antagonism kept university \\nscientists free of contaminating in dustry ties, and whenever debate \\narose about technological matters,  disinterested scientists were \\navailable to discuss the issues at the highest levels. \\n    But that is no longer true. There are very few molecular biologists and \\nvery few research institutions with out commercial affiliations. The old \\ndays are gone. Genetic research contin ues, at a more furious pace than \\never. But it is done in secret, and in haste, and for profit. \\n \\nIn this commercial climate, it is pr obably inevitable that a company as \\nambitious as International Genetic Technologies, Inc., of Palo Alto, would \\narise.

It was irresponsible. It was criminally negligent. \\nBut no action was taken against Biosyn. The Chilean farmers who \\nunwittingly risked their lives were ignorant peasants; the government of \\nChile had an economic crisis to  worry about; and the American \\nauthorities had no jurisdiction. So  Lewis Dodgson, the geneticist \\nresponsible for the test, was still work ing at Biosyn. Biosyn was still as \\nreckless as ever. And other American companies were hurrying to set up \\nfacilities in foreign countries that  lacked sophistication about genetic \\nresearch. Countries that perceived ge netic engineering to be like any \\nother high-tech development, and thus welcomed it to their lands, \\nunaware of the dangers posed. \\n    \"So that\\'s why we began our investigation of InGen,\" Morris said. \\n\"About three weeks ago.\" \\n    \"And what have you actually found?\" Grant said. \\n    \"Not much,\" Morris admitted. \"W hen I go back to San Francisco, we\\'ll \\nprobably have to close the investigat ion.

So it was unlikely \\nthat they would find the remains of a large predator. \\n    But where were the smaller predators? Snakewater had dozens of \\nnesting sites-in some places, the ground was literally covered with \\nfragments of dinosaur eggshells-and many small dinosaurs ate eggs. \\nAnimals like Dromaeosaurus, Ovirap tor, Velociraptor, and Coelurus-\\npredators three to six feet tall-must have been found here in abundance. \\n    But they had discovered none so far. \\n    Perhaps this velociraptor skeleton did mean their luck had changed. \\nAnd an infant!

The skeleton is so light.\" \\n    \"But it\\'s no lizard,\" she said. \\n    \"No,\" Grant said. \"This is not a li zard. No three-toed lizard has walked \\non this planet for two hundred million years.\" \\n    Ellie\\'s first thought was that she was looking at a hoax-an ingenious, \\nskillful hoax, but a hoax nonetheless. Every biologist knew that the \\nthreat of a hoax was omnipresent. The most famous hoax, the Piltdown \\nman, had gone undetected for forty years, and its perpetrator was still \\nunknown. More recently, the distin guished astronomer Fred Hoyle had \\nclaimed that a fossil winged dinosaur, Archaeopteryx, on display in the \\nBritish Museum, was a fraud. (It was later shown to be genuine.) \\n    The essence of a successful hoax was that it presented scientists \\nwith what they expected to see. And,  to Ellie\\'s eye, the X-ray image of \\nthe lizard was exactly correct. The three-toed foot was well balanced, \\nwith the medial claw smallest. The bony remnants of the fourth and fifth \\ntoes were located up near the metatarsal joint. The tibia was strong, and \\nconsiderably longer than the femur.  At the hip, the acetabulum was \\ncomplete. The tail showed fort y-five vertebrae. It was a \\nProcompsognathus. \\n    \"Could this X-ray be faked?\" \\n    \"I don\\'t know,\" Grant said. \"But it\\'s almost impossible to fake an X-\\nray. And Procompsognathus is an ob scure animal.

Even a child would look \\npretty fearsome to it. It might bite an infant, but not a child.\" \\n    Ellie frowned at the X-ray image. \"You think this could really be a \\nlegitimate rediscovery?\" she said. \"Like the coelacanth?\" \\n    \"Maybe,\" Grant said. The coelac anth was a five-foot-long fish thought \\nto have died out sixty-five million years ago, until a specimen was pulled \\nfrom the ocean in 1938. But there were other examples. The Australian \\nmountain pygmy possum was known only from fossils until a live one was \\nfound in a garbage can in Melbourne. And a ten-thousand-year-old fossil \\nfruit bat from New Guinea was described by a zoologist who not long \\nafterward received a living specimen in the mail. \\n    \"But could it be real?\" she persisted. \"What about the age?\" \\n    Grant nodded. \"The age is a problem.\" \\n    Most rediscovered animals were rather recent additions to the fossil \\nrecord: ten or twenty thousand years old. Some were a few million years \\nold- in the case of the coelacanth, sixty-five million years old. But the \\nspecimen they were looking at was much, much older than that. Dinosaurs \\nhad died out in the Cretaceous period, sixty-five million years ago. They \\nhad flourished as the dominant life form on the planet in the Jurassic, \\n190 million years ago. And they had first appeared in the Triassic, \\nroughly 220 million years ago. \\n    It was during the early Triassic period that Procompsognathus had \\nlived-a time so distant that our planet  didn\\'t even look the same. All the \\ncontinents were joined together in  a single landmass, called Pangaca, \\nwhich extended from the North to the South Pole-a vast continent of \\nferns and forests, with a few large deserts.

It\\'s not bad.\" \\n    Grant went to look at the computer screen. He saw the complete \\nskeleton, traced in bright yellow. It was indeed a young specimen. The \\noutstanding characteristic of Velociraptor-the single-toed claw, which in \\na full-grown animal was a curved, six- inch-long weapon capable of ripping \\nopen its prey-was in this infant no larger than the thorn on a rosebush. \\nIt was hardly visible at all on the screen. And Velociraptor was a lightly \\nbuilt dinosaur in any case, an animal as fine-boned as a bird, and \\npresumably as intelligent. \\n    Here the skeleton appeared in perfect order, except that the head \\nand neck were bent back, toward the posterior. Such neck flexion was so \\ncommon in fossils that some scient ists had formulated a theory to \\nexplain it, suggesting that the dinosaurs had become extinct because \\nthey had been poisoned by the evolvi ng alkaloids in plants. The twisted \\nneck was thought to signify the deat h agony of the dinosaurs. Grant had \\nfinally put that one to rest, by demo nstrating that many species of birds \\nand reptiles underwent a postmortem  contraction of posterior neck \\nligaments, which bent the head backwar d in a characteristic way. It had \\nnothing to do with the cause of death; it had to do with the way a \\ncarcass dried in the sun. \\n    Grant saw that this particular skeleton had also been twisted laterally, \\nso that the right leg and foot were raised up above the backbone. \\n    \"It looks kind of distorted,\" on e of the kids said. \"But I don\\'t think \\nit\\'s the computer.\" \\n    \"No,\" Grant said. \"It\\'s just time.

If you \\nimagined the human lifespan of sixt y years was compressed to an hour, \\nthen eighty million years would still be 3,652 years-older than the \\npyramids. The velociraptor had been dead a long time. \\n    \"Doesn\\'t look very fearsome,\" one of the kids said. \\n    \"He wasn\\'t,\" Grant said. \"At least, not until he grew up.\" Probably this \\nbaby had scavenged, feeding off carcas ses slain by the adults, after the \\nbig animals had gorged themselves, and lay basking in the sun.

The babies would chitter and \\nscramble over the indulgent, somnolent bodies of the adults, and nip \\nlittle bites from the dead animal.

They had all studied animal behavior, and they \\nknew, for example, that when a new male took over a lion pride, the first \\nthing he did was kill all the cubs. The reason was apparently genetic: the \\nmale had evolved to disseminate his ge nes as widely as possible, and by \\nkilling the cubs he brought all the females into heat, so that he could \\nimpregnate them. It also prevented the females from wasting their time \\nnurturing the offspring of another male. \\n    Perhaps the velociraptor huntin g pack was also ruled by a dominant \\nmale.

He looked older \\nthan Gennaro remembered, but then, Gennaro hadn\\'t seen him for almost \\nfive years. \\n    Hammond was flamboyant, a born showman, and back in 1983 he had \\nhad an elephant that he carried ar ound with him in a little cage. The \\nelephant was nine inches high and a foot long, and perfectly formed, \\nexcept his tusks were stunted. Hammo nd took the elephant with him to \\nfund-raising meetings.

And he would ask for \\nmoney. \\n    The elephant was always a rousing success; its tiny body, hardly bigger \\nthan a cat\\'s, promised untold wonder s to come from the laboratory of \\nNorman Atherton, the Stanford gene ticist who was Hammond\\'s partner \\nin the new venture. \\n    But as Hammond talked about the elephant, he left a great deal \\nunsaid. For example, Hammond was starting a genetics company, but the \\ntiny elephant hadn\\'t been made by any genetic procedure; Atherton had \\nsimply taken a dwarf-elephant embryo and raised it in an artificial womb \\nwith hormonal modifications. That in itself was quite an achievement, but \\nnothing like what Hammond hinted had been done. \\n    Also, Atherton hadn\\'t been abl e to duplicate his miniature elephant, \\nand he\\'d tried. For one thing, ever ybody who saw the elephant wanted \\none. Then, too, the elephant was pr one to colds, particularly during \\nwinter. The sneezes coming through th e little trunk filled Hammond with \\ndread. And sometimes the elephant would get his tusks stuck between \\nthe bars of the cage and snort irritably as he tried to get free; \\nsometimes he got infections around the tusk line. Hammond always \\nfretted that his elephant would die before Atherton could grow a \\nreplacement. \\n    Hammond also concealed from pr ospective investors the fact that the \\nelephant\\'s behavior had changed substantially in the process of \\nminiaturization. The little creature mi ght look like an elephant, but he \\nacted like a vicious rodent, quick-m oving and mean-tempered. Hammond \\ndiscouraged people from petting the elephant, to avoid nipped fingers. \\n    And although Hammond spoke conf idently of seven bi llion dollars in \\nannual revenues by 1993, his project was intensely speculative. Hammond \\nhad vision and enthusiasm, but there wa s no certainty that his plan would \\nwork at all.

Before we \\ngo, I wanted to review why we are here, and what I need to decide \\nbefore we leave. Basically, as you all re alize by now, this is an island in \\nwhich genetically engineered dinosaur s have been allowed to move in a \\nnatural park-like setting, forming a tourist attraction. The attraction \\nisn\\'t open to tourists yet, but it will be in a year. \\n    \"Now, my question for you is a simp le one. Is this island safe? Is it \\nsafe for visitors, and is it safely containing the dinosaurs?\" \\n    Gennaro turned down the room lights. \"There are two pieces of \\nevidence which we have to deal with. First of all, there is Dr. Grant\\'s \\nidentification of a previously un known dinosaur on the Costa Rican \\nmainland. This dinosaur is known on ly from a partial fragment.

These lizard bites were spor adically reported in coastal villages \\nfrom Ismaloya to Puntarenas. After Ma rch, lizard bites were no longer \\nreported. However, I have this graph from the Public Health Service in \\nSan Jos6 of infant mortality in the towns of the west coast earlier this \\nyear.\" \\n \\n    \"I direct your attention to two features of this graph,\" Gennaro said. \\n\"First, infant mortality is low in the months of January and February, \\nthen spikes in March, then it\\'s low again in April. But from May onward, \\nit is high, right through July, the month the American girl was bitten. \\nThe Public Health Service feels that  something is now affecting infant \\nmortality, and it is not being repo rted by the workers in the coastal \\nvillages.

Arnold knew there was no point \\nin antagonizing Nedry while he was working. \\n    \"It\\'s a large system,\" Arnold said. \"There are bound to be glitches.\" \\n    In fact, the bug list now ran to more than 130 items, and included \\nmany odd aspects. For example: \\n    The animal-feeding program reset itself every twelve hours, not every \\ntwenty-four hours, and would not record feedings on Sundays. As a \\nresult, the staff could not accurately measure how much the animals \\nwere eating. \\n    The security system, which controlled all the security-card-operated \\ndoors, cut out whenever main power was lost, and did not come back on \\nwith auxiliary power. The security Program only ran with main power. \\n    The physical conservation progra m, intended to dim lights after 10:00 \\np.m., only worked on alternate days of the week. \\n    The automated fecal analysis (called Auto Poop), designed to check for \\nparasites in the animal stools, invariably recorded all specimens as having \\nthe parasite Phagostomum venulosum, although none did. The program \\nthen automatically dispensed medication into the animals\\' food. If the \\nhandlers dumped the medicine out of  the hoppers to prevent its being \\ndispensed, an alarm sounded which could not be turned off. \\n    And so it went, page after page of errors. \\n    When he had arrived, Dennis Nedry had been under the impression \\nthat he could make all the fixes himself over the weekend.

Two broad curving \\ncrests ran along the top of the head  from the eyes to the nose.

But since 1980, he had worked principally for conservation groups \\nand zoo designers as a wildlife consul tant. He had become well known; an \\narticle in the London Sunday Times had said, \"What Robert Trent Jones \\nis to golf courses, Robert Muldoon is to zoos: a designer of unsurpassed \\nknowledge and skill.\" \\n    In 1986, he had done some work for a San Francisco company that was \\nbuilding a private wildlife park on an island in North America. Muldoon \\nhad laid out the boundaries for diff erent animals, defining space and \\nhabitat requirements for lions, elephants, zebras, and hippos. Identifying \\nwhich animals could be kept together, and which had to be separated. At \\nthe time, it had been a fairly routine job. He had been more interested in \\nan Indian park called TigerWorld in southern Kashmir. \\n    Then, a year ago, he was offered a job as game warden of Jurassic \\nPark. It coincided with a desire to leave Africa; the salary was excellent; \\nMuldoon had taken it on for a year.

In Muldoon's opinion, cl oning dinosaurs in a laboratory was \\none thing. Maintaining them in the wild was quite another. \\n    It was Muldoon's view that some  dinosaurs were too dangerous to be \\nkept in a park setting. In part, the danger existed because they still \\nknew so little about the animals. For example, nobody even suspected the \\ndilophosaurs were poisonous until they  were observed hunting indigenous \\nrats on the island-biting the rodents and then stepping back, to wait for \\nthem to die. And even then nobody suspected the dilophosaurs could spit \\nuntil one of the handlers was almost blinded by spitting venom. \\n    After that, Hammond had agreed to study dilophosaur venom, which \\nwas found to contain seven different toxic enzymes. It was also \\ndiscovered that the dilophosaurs could spit a distance of fifty feet. \\nSince this raised the possibility that a guest in a car might be blinded, \\nmanagement decided to remove the poison sacs. The vets had tried \\ntwice, on two different animals, without success, No one knew where the \\npoison was being secreted. And no one would ever know until an autopsy \\nwas performed on a dilophosaur and management would not allow one to \\nbe killed. \\n    Muldoon worried even more about the velociraptors. They were \\ninstinctive hunters, and they never passed up prey, They killed even when \\nthey 't weren't hungry. They killed fo r the pleasure of killing. They were \\nswift: strong runners and astonishing jumpers. They had lethal claws on \\nall four limbs; one swipe of a forearm would disembowel a man, spilling his \\nguts out. And they had powerful te aring jaws that ripped flesh instead \\nof biting it. They were far more inte lligent than the other dinosaurs, and \\nthey seemed to be natural cage-breakers. \\n    Every zoo expert knew that cert ain animals were especially likely to \\nget free of their cages. Some, like monkeys and elephants, could undo \\ncage doors. Others, like wild pigs, were unusually intelligent and could lift \\ngate fasteners with their snouts.

And, in the end, a complete refusal to deal with the \\nsituation that now faced the park. \\n    Wu had been stunned by the evid ence (he did not yet allow himself to \\nbelieve the case was proved) that the dinosaurs were breeding. After \\nGrant had asked about amphibian DNA, Wu had intended to go directly \\nto his laboratory and check the computer records of the various DNA \\nassemblies. Because, if the dinosa urs were in fact breeding, then \\neverything about Jurassic Park was called into question-their genetic \\ndevelopment methods, their genetic control methods, everything.

If anything, \\nscreaming was counterproductive, be cause Arnold now faced the virtual \\ncertainty that Nedry wasn\\'t coming  back, which meant that Arnold \\nhimself had to go into the computer  code and try and figure out what \\nhad gone wrong.

At the base of the hill Gennaro \\nsaw something white, lying among the ferns by the side of the road. \\n\"Hold it,\" Gennaro said, and Muldoon braked. Gennaro jumped out and ran \\nforward in the headlights of the Jeep to see what it was.

Below the calf he saw a white \\nsock, and a brown slip-on shoe. It was the kind of sboe Ed Regis had been \\nwearing. \\n    By then Muldoon was out of the car, running past him to crouch over \\nthe leg. \"Jesus.\" He lifted the leg ou t of the foliage, raising it into the \\nlight of the headlamps, and blood from the stump gushed down over his \\nband. Gennaro was still three feet away. He quickly bent over, put his \\nhands on his knees, squeezed his eyes shut, and breathed deeply, trying \\nnot to be sick. \\n    \"Gennaro.\" Muldoon\\'s voice was sharp. \\n    \"What?\" \\n    \"Move.

He felt grateful to think about something else for \\na moment. The problem of how to wrap the severed leg expanded to fill \\nhis mind, crowding out all other thou ghts. He found a canvas bag with a \\ntool kit, a wheel rim, a cardboard box, and- \\n    \"Two tarps,\" he said. They were neatly folded plastic. \\n    \"Give me one,\" Muldoon said, still standing outside the car. Muldoon \\nwrapped the leg and passed the now shapeless bundle to Gennaro.

He accelerated, the wheels  spinning in the mud, then digging \\nin. The Jeep rushed up the hill, and for a moment at the top the \\nheadlights still pointed upward into  the foliage, and then they swung \\ndown, and Gennaro could see the road before them. \\n    \"Jesus,\" Muldoon said. \\n    Gennaro saw a single Land Cruiser, lying on its side in the center of the \\nroad. He couldn\\'t see the second Land Cruiser at all. \"Where\\'s the other \\ncar?\" \\n    Muldoon looked around briefly,  pointed to the left. \"There.\" The \\nsecond Land Cruiser was twenty feet  away, crumpled at the foot of a \\ntree. \\n    \"What\\'s it doing there?\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/290b41329dfe790093b4b8fae7d81a93ea1cb17b0c164399c6e9c77dbfdf60c9/JurassicPark.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content='\"The T-rex threw it.\" \\n    \"Threw it?\" Gennaro said. \\n    Muldoon\\'s face was grim. \"Let\\'s get this over with,\" he said, climbing \\nout of the Jeep.

He was \\ncareful to let Muldoon look inside first. \\n    \"I wouldn\\'t worry,\" Muldoon said. \"It\\'s very unlikely we\\'ll find anyone.\" \\n    \"No?\" \\n    \"No,\" he said. He explained that, during his years in Africa, he had \\nvisited the scenes of a half-dozen an imal attacks on humans in the bush. \\nOne leopard attack: the leopard had torn open a tent in the night and \\ntaken a three-year-old child. Then one buffalo attack in Amboseli; two \\nlion attacks; one croc attack in the north, near Meru. In every case, \\nthere was surprisingly little evidence left behind. \\n    Inexperienced people imagined horrific proofs of an animal attack-\\ntorn limbs left behind in the tent, tr ails of dripping blood leading away \\ninto the bush, bloodstained clothing not far from the campsite. But the \\ntruth was, there was usually nothing at  all, particularly if the victim was \\nsmall, an infant or a young child. Th e person just seemed to disappear, as \\nif he had walked out into the bush and never come back. A predator could \\nkill a child just by shaking it, snapping the neck. Usually there wasn\\'t any \\nblood. \\n    And most of the time you never found any other remains of the \\nvictims. Sometimes a button from a sh irt, or a sliver of rubber from a \\nshoe. But most of the time, nothing. \\n    Predators took children-they preferred children-and they left nothing \\nbehind. So Muldoon thought it highly unlikely that they would ever find \\nany remains of the children. \\n    But as he looked in now, he had a surprise. \"I\\'ll be damned,\" he said. \\n \\nMuldoon tried to put the scene toge ther.

His flashlight glinted off a Crushed radio \\nhandset, and on the floor of the ca r he saw something else, something \\ncurved and black. The front doors we re dented and jammed shut, but he \\nclimbed in through the back door and crawled over the seat to pick up \\nthe black object. \\n    \"It\\'s a watch,\" he said, peering at it in the beam of his flashlight.

The velociraptor looked at him with slightly glazed eyes. \\n    Grant had a clear feeling of inte lligence from this creature, a kind of \\nsoftness which contrasted strangely with the menace he had felt from \\nthe adults in the pen. He stroked the head of the velociraptor, hoping to \\ncalm it. He looked down at the body, which was shivering slightly as the \\ntranquilizer took hold. And then he saw it was a male. \\n    A young juvenile, and a male. There was no question what he was \\nseeing. This velociraptor had been bred in the wild. \\n    Excited by this development, he hurried back up the stairs to the \\ndoor.

All around him, the \\nyoung velociraptors were scampering and kicking in the sand. But, one by \\none, the animals moved back into the shade of the palm trees at the edge \\nof the mangrove swamp, and there they stood, lined up in their peculiar \\nfashion, watching the ocean. They stared fixedly to the south. \\n    \"I don\\'t get it,\" Gennaro said. \\n    \"I don\\'t, either,\" Grant said, \"except that they clearly don\\'t like the \\nsun.\" It wasn\\'t very sunn y on the beach; a light mist blew, and the ocean \\nwas hazy. But why had they suddenly left the nest? What had brought \\nthe entire colony to the beach? \\n    Gennaro flipped up the dial on his watch, and looked at the way the \\nanimals were standing. \"Northeast-soutbwest. Same as before.\" \\n    Behind the beach, deeper in the woods, they heard the hum of the \\nelectric fence. \"At least we know ho w they get outside the fence,\" Ellie \\nsaid. \\n    Then they heard the throb of marine diesels, and through the mist \\nthey saw a ship appearing in the south.  A large freighter, it slowly moved \\nnorth. \\n    \"So that\\'s why they came out?\" Gennaro said.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/290b41329dfe790093b4b8fae7d81a93ea1cb17b0c164399c6e9c77dbfdf60c9/JurassicPark.pdf', 'page': 409}, page_content='Grant nodded. \"They must have heard it coming,\" \\n    As the freighter passed, all the animals watched it, standing silent \\nexcept for the occasional chirp or squeak. Grant was struck by the \\ncoordination of their behavior, the way they moved and acted as a group. \\nBut perhaps it was not really so mysterious. In his mind, he reviewed the \\nsequence of events that had begun in the cave. \\n    First the infants had been agitat ed. Then the adults had noticed. And \\nfinally all the animals had stampeded to the beach. That sequence \\nseemed to imply that the younger an imals, with keener bearing, had \\ndetected the boat first. Then the ad ults had led the troop out onto the \\nbeach. And as Grant looked, he saw th at the adults were in charge now. \\nThere was a clear spatial organization along the beach, and as the animals \\nsettled down, it was not loose and sh ifting, the way it had been inside. \\nRather, it was quite regular, almost regimented. The adults were spaced \\nevery ten yards or so, each adult surro unded by a cluster of infants. The \\njuveniles were positioned between, and slightly ahead of, the adults. \\n    But Grant also saw that all th e adults were not equal. There was a \\nfemale with a distinctive stripe alon g her head, and she was in the very \\ncenter of the group as it ranged along the beach. That same female had \\nstayed in the center of the nesting area, too. He guessed that, like \\ncertain monkey troops, the raptors we re organized around a matriarchal \\npecking order, and that this striped animal was the alpha female of the \\ncolony. The males, he saw, were arranged defensively at the perimeter of \\nthe group. \\n    But unlike monkeys, which were loosely and flexibly organized, the \\ndinosaurs settled into a rigid arrangement-almost a military formation, it \\nseemed. Then, too, there was the o ddity of the northeast-southwest \\nspatial orientation. That was beyond Gr ant. But, in another sense, he was \\nnot surprised. Paleontologists had been  digging up bones for so long that \\nthey had forgotten how little information could be gleaned from a \\nskeleton. Bones might tell you something about the gross appearance of \\nan animal, its height and weight. They might tell you something about how \\nthe muscles attached, and therefore something about the crude behavior \\nof the animal during life. They migh t give you clues to the few diseases'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/290b41329dfe790093b4b8fae7d81a93ea1cb17b0c164399c6e9c77dbfdf60c9/JurassicPark.pdf', 'page': 410}, page_content='that affected bone. But a skeleton was a poor thing, really, from which \\nto try and deduce the total behavior of an organism. \\n    Since bones were all the paleontologists had, bones were what they \\nused. Like other paleontologists, Grant had become very expert at \\nworking with bones. And somewhere along the way, he had started to \\nforget the unprovable possibilities- that the dinosaurs might be truly \\ndifferent animals, that they migh t possess behavior and social life \\norganized along lines that were utterly mysterious to their later, \\nmammalian descendants. That, since the dinosaurs were fundamentally \\nbirds- \\n    \"Oh, my God,\" Grant said. \\n    He stared at the raptors, ranged along the beach in a rigid formation, \\nsilently watching the boat. And he suddenly understood what he was \\nlooking at. \\n    \"Those animals,\" Gennaro said, shaking his head, \"they sure are \\ndesperate to escape from here.\" \\n    \"No,\" Grant said. \"They don\\'t want to escape at all.\" \\n    \"They don\\'t?\" \\n    \"No,\" Grant said. \"They want to migrate.\" \\n \\nApproaching Dark \\n \\n\"Migrating!\" Ellie said. \"That\\'s fantastic!\" \\n    \"Yes,\" Grant said.
