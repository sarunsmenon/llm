            " docs returned is :: 2 whose contents are Umbriel () is the third-largest moon of Uranus. It was discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell at the same time as neighboring moon Ariel. It was named after a character in Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts, but the presence of canyons suggests early internal processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\n",
            "Covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second-most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all regular moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation. Umbriel has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\n",
            "\n",
            "== Orbit ==\n",
            "Umbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about 266,000 km (165,000 mi), being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1 Earth days, coincident with its rotational period, making it a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).

              "{'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"Umbriel () is the third-largest moon of Uranus. It was discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell at the same time as neighboring moon Ariel. It was named after a character in Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts, but the presence of canyons suggests early internal processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\\nCovered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second-most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all regular moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation. Umbriel has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon's surface.\\n\\n== Orbit ==\\nUmbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about 266,000 km (165,000 mi), being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1 Earth days, coincident with its rotational period, making it a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.\\nBecause Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, Umbriel and the other moons are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the Sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice.

Major temples and homes are decorated with lights, festive foods\\nshared with all, friends and relatives remembered and visited with gifts.[133][97]\\nThe day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik.[145] It is regionally called Annakut\\n(heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and\\nother names.[27][145] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali\\'s defeat at\\nthe hands of Vishnu.[146][147] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati\\nand her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces,\\nParvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked.[145] According\\nto Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic\\nprocess for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as\\nrepresented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve\\nreflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar\\nmonth.[145]\\nThis day ritually celebrates the bond between the wife and husband,[148] and in some Hindu\\ncommunities, husbands will celebrate this with gifts to their wives. In other regions, parents invite a\\nnewly married daughter, or son, together with their spouses to a festive meal and give them gifts.[148]\\nIn some rural communities of the north, west and central regions, the fourth day is celebrated as\\nGovardhan puja, honouring the legend of the Hindu god Krishna saving the cowherd and farming\\ncommunities from incessant rains and floods triggered by Indra\\'s anger,[148] which he accomplished\\nby lifting the Govardhan mountain.

It celebrates the sister-brother bond,\\nsimilar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels\\nto meet the sister and her family. This festive day is interpreted by\\nsome to symbolise Yama\\'s sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a\\ntilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister\\nSubhadra\\'s place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes\\nhim with a tilaka on his forehead.[148][152]\\nThe day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and sister.[153]\\nOn this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja\\nwith prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their brothers with\\ntheir hands and receiving gifts.

In 2013, about ₹25 billion (US$300 million) of fireworks were sold to merchants for the\\nDiwali season, an equivalent retail value of about ₹50 billion (US$600 million) according to The\\nTimes of India.[167][r] ASSOCHAM, a trade organisation in India, forecasted that online shopping\\nalone to be over ₹300 billion (US$3.6 billion) over the 2017 Diwali season.[170] About two-thirds of\\nIndian households, according to the ASSOCHAM forecast, would spend between ₹5,000 (US$60) and\\n₹10,000 (US$120) to celebrate Diwali in 2017.[171] Stock markets like NSE and BSE in India are\\ntypically closed during Diwali, with the exception of a Diwali Muhurat trading session for an hour in\\nthe evening to coincide with the beginning of the new year.[172] In 2020, the INDF ETF was launched\\nto mark the start of Diwali.[173]\\nDiwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious\\nleaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours.

According to Audrey Truschke, the Sunni Muslim emperor Aurangzeb did limit \"public observation\"\\nof many religious holidays such as Hindu Diwali and Holi, but also of Shia observance of\\nMuharram and the Persian holiday of Nauruz. According to Truschke, Aurangzeb did so because he\\nfound the festivals \"distasteful\" and also from \"concerns with public safety\" lurking in the\\nbackground.[67] According to Stephen Blake, a part of the reason that led Aurangzeb to ban Diwali\\nwas the practice of gambling and drunken celebrations.[66] Truschke states that Aurangzeb did not\\nban private practices altogether and instead \"rescinded taxes previously levied on Hindu festivals\"\\nby his Mughal predecessors.[67] John Richards disagrees and states Aurangzeb, in his zeal to\\nrevive Islam and introduce strict Sharia in his empire, issued a series of edicts against Hindu\\nfestivals and shrines.[68] According to Richards, it was Akbar who abolished the discriminatory\\ntaxes on Hindu festivals and pilgrims, and it was Aurangzeb who reinstated the Mughal era\\ndiscriminatory taxes on festivals and increased other religion-based taxes.[68]\\nf. Some Muslims joined the Hindu community in celebrating Diwali in the Mughal era. Illustrative\\nIslamic records, states Stephen Blake, include those of 16th-century Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi who\\nwrote, \"during Diwali.... the ignorant ones amongst Muslims, particularly women, perform the\\nceremonies... they celebrate it like their own Id and send presents to their daughters and sisters,....\\nthey attach much importance and weight to this season [of Diwali].\"[66]\\ng. Williams Jones stated that the Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam is dedicated to Yama and ancestral\\nspirits, the Lacshmipuja dipanwita to goddess Lakshmi with invocations to Kubera, the Dyuta\\npratipat Belipuja to Shiva-Parvati and Bali legends, and the Bhratri dwitiya to Yama-Yamuna\\nlegend and the Hindus celebrate the brother-sister relationship on this day.[69] Jones also noted\\nthat on the Diwali day, the Hindus had a mock cremation ceremony with \"torches and flaming\\nbrands\" called Ulcadanam, where they said goodbye to their colleagues who had died in war or in\\na foreign country and had never returned home. The ceremony lit the path of the missing to the\\nmansion of Yama.[69]\\nh. Some inscriptions mention the festival of lights in Prakrit terms such as tipa-malai, sara-vilakku and\\nothers.\\ni. The Sanskrit inscription is in the Grantha script. It is well preserved on the north wall of the second\\nprakara in the Ranganatha temple, Srirangam island, Tamil Nadu.[75]\\nj. The Diwali-related inscription is the 4th inscription and it includes the year Vikrama Era 1268 (c.\\n1211 CE).[78]\\nk. Scholars contest the 527 BCE date and consider Mahavira\\'s biographical details as uncertain.\\nSome suggest he lived in the 5th-century BCE contemporaneously with the Buddha.[98][99]\\nl. Sikhs historically referred to this festival as Diwali. It was in early 20th-century, states Harjot Oberoi,\\na scholar of Sikh history, when the Khalsa Tract Society triggered by the Singh Sabha Movement\\nsought to establish a Sikh identity distinct from the Hindus and the Muslims.[107] They launched a\\nsustained campaign to discourage Sikhs from participating in Holi and Diwali, renaming the\\nfestivals, publishing the seasonal greeting cards in the Gurmukhi language and relinking their\\nreligious significance to Sikh historical events.[108] While some of these efforts have had a lasting\\nimpact for the Sikh community, the lighting, feasting together, social bonding, sharing and other\\nritual grammar of Sikh celebrations during the Diwali season are similar to those of the Hindus and\\nJains.[108]\\nm. Hindus of eastern and northeastern states of India associate the festival with the goddess Durga, or\\nher fierce avatar Kali (Shaktism).[84] According to McDermott, this region also celebrated the\\nLakshmi puja historically, while the Kali puja tradition started during the British Raj and was\\nparticularly prominent from the 1920s.[111]\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 16/34'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/9f7810f43c85598e4a6abbbfa30dedff0f440ac3738fd2bba0b2a0bffba295cb/Diwali - Wikipedia.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='n. According to McDermott, while the Durga Puja is the largest Bengali festival and it can be traced to\\nthe 16th-century or earlier, the start of Kali puja tradition on Diwali is traceable to no earlier than\\nabout the mid-18th-century during the reign of Raja Krishnacandra Ray.[111] McDermott further\\nwrites that the older historic documents of the Bengal confirm that the Bengali Hindus have long\\ncelebrated the night of Diwali with illuminations, firecrackers, foods, new account books, Lakshmi\\n(not Kali), inviting their friends (including Europeans during the colonial era) and gambling.[111] The\\nKali sarbajanin tradition on Diwali, with tantric elements in some locations, grew slowly into a\\npopular Bengali tradition after the mid-1920s.[111]\\no. According to a Government of Himachal Pradesh and India publication, the Vishvakarma puja is\\nobserved on the fourth day of Diwali in the Himalayan state.[154]\\np. The Vishwakarma puja day is alternatively observed in other Hindu communities in accordance\\nwith the Hindu solar calendar, and this falls in September.[155]\\nq. Max Macauliffe, who lived in northwest Punjab area during the colonial era and is known for his\\nwork on Sikh literature and history, wrote about Diwali melas to which people visited to buy horses,\\nseek pleasure, pray in nearby Amritsar temples for the prosperity of their children and their souls,\\nand some on \"errands, more or less worthy or unworthy character\".[158]\\nr. A 2017 estimate states 50,000 tons (100 million pounds) of fireworks are exploded annually in India\\nover the Diwali festival.[168] As a comparison, Americans explode 134,000 tons (268 million\\npounds) of fireworks for 4 July celebrations in the United States.[169]\\ns. The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by\\nPope Paul VI. It began sending official greetings and message to Muslims in 1967 on Id al-Fitr.\\nAbout 30 years later, in the mid-1990s the Catholic authorities began sending two additional annual\\nofficial greetings and message, one to the Hindus on Diwali and the other to the Buddhists on\\nBuddha\\'s birthday.[174]\\nt. Diwali was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Diwali along with Holi for Hindus,\\nand Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan\\'s parliament in\\n2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and\\ngrant leave for its minority communities, for the first time.[184][185] Diwali celebrations have been\\nrelatively rare in contemporary Pakistan, but observed across religious lines, including by Muslims\\nin cities such as Peshawar.[186]\\n1.

The Lacshmipuja\\ndipanwita, remarked Jones, was a \"great festival at night, in honour of Lakshmi, with illuminations\\non trees and houses\".[69][g]\\nSanskrit inscriptions in stone and copper mentioning Diwali,\\noccasionally alongside terms such as Dipotsava, Dipavali, Divali\\nand Divalige, have been discovered at numerous sites across\\nIndia.[71][72][h] Examples include a 10th-century Rashtrakuta\\nempire copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939–967 CE) that\\nmentions Dipotsava,[73] and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-\\nKannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of\\nDharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival\\nas a \"sacred occasion\".[74] According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a\\nGerman Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions,\\nthis festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the\\nRanganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad\\nHindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira.

Diwali was celebrated as a signifier of triumph of\\ngood over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura. The day before\\nDiwali is remembered as Naraka Chaturdashi, the day on which\\nNarakasura was killed by Krishna.[82]\\nMany Hindus associate the festival with Goddess Lakshmi, the\\ngoddess of wealth and prosperity, and wife of Vishnu. According to\\nPintchman, the start of the 5-day Diwali festival is stated in some\\npopular contemporary sources as the day goddess Lakshmi was\\nborn from Samudra Manthana, the churning of the cosmic ocean of\\nmilk by the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) – a Vedic legend\\nthat is also found in several Puranas such as the Padma Purana,\\nwhile the night of Diwali is when Lakshmi chose and wed\\nVishnu.[42][83] Along with Lakshmi, who is representative of\\nVaishnavism, Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Parvati and\\nShiva of Shaivism tradition, is remembered as one who symbolises\\nethical beginnings and the remover of obstacles.[80]\\nHindus of eastern India associate the festival with the Goddess\\nKali, who symbolises the victory of good over evil.[84][85][86]\\nHindus from the Braj region in northern India, parts of Assam, as\\nwell as southern Tamil and Telugu communities view Diwali as the\\nday the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king\\nNarakasura, in yet another symbolic victory of knowledge and good\\nover ignorance and evil.[87][88]\\nReligious significance\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 5/34\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/9f7810f43c85598e4a6abbbfa30dedff0f440ac3738fd2bba0b2a0bffba295cb/Diwali - Wikipedia.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Trade and merchant families and others also offer prayers to Saraswati, who embodies music,\\nliterature and learning and Kubera, who symbolises book-keeping, treasury and wealth\\nmanagement.[42] In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of\\nIndia, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.[87]\\nMythical tales shared on Diwali vary widely depending on region and even within Hindu tradition,[89]\\nyet all share a common focus on righteousness, self-inquiry and the importance of knowledge,[90][91]\\nwhich, according to Lindsey Harlan, an Indologist and scholar of Religious Studies, is the path to\\novercoming the \"darkness of ignorance\".[92] The telling of these myths are reminiscent of the Hindu\\nbelief that good ultimately triumphs over evil.[93][10]\\nOriginally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines.[94] Diwali is celebrated by Hindus,\\nJains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists,[2] although for each faith it marks different historical events and\\nstories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness,\\nknowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.[5][6][95][96]\\nA scholar of Jain and Nivethan, states that in Jain tradition, Diwali is celebrated in observance of\\n\"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira. The Jain Diwali\\ncelebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of\\nlamps and the offering of prayers to Lakshmi. However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the\\ndedication to Mahavira.[97] According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began\\non the day of Mahavira\\'s nirvana in 527 BCE,[k] when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira\\'s final\\nteachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the \"great light,\\nMahavira\".[100][101] This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is\\nreflected in their historic artworks such as paintings.[102]\\nSikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the\\nGwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in\\nAmritsar.[103] According to J.S.

For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes,\\nor defiled souls of one\\'s ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife.[126] A\\nmythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by\\nKrishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura.[125] It is also\\ncelebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise,\\nwhile lighting a Diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun\\nritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities. Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of\\nspecial gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.\\nNaraka Chaturdashi is also a major day for purchasing festive foods, particularly sweets. A variety of\\nsweets are prepared using flour, semolina, rice, chickpea flour, dry fruit pieces powders or paste, milk\\nsolids (mawa or khoya) and clarified butter (ghee).[10] According to Goldstein, these are then shaped\\ninto various forms, such as laddus, barfis, halwa, kachoris, shrikhand, and sandesh, rolled and stuffed\\ndelicacies, such as karanji, shankarpali, maladu, susiyam, pottukadalai.

One tradition starts a new month from the\\nnew moon, while the other starts it from the full moon.[50]\\nSee also\\nNotes\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 15/34\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/9f7810f43c85598e4a6abbbfa30dedff0f440ac3738fd2bba0b2a0bffba295cb/Diwali - Wikipedia.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='e. According to Audrey Truschke, the Sunni Muslim emperor Aurangzeb did limit \"public observation\"\\nof many religious holidays such as Hindu Diwali and Holi, but also of Shia observance of\\nMuharram and the Persian holiday of Nauruz. According to Truschke, Aurangzeb did so because he\\nfound the festivals \"distasteful\" and also from \"concerns with public safety\" lurking in the\\nbackground.[67] According to Stephen Blake, a part of the reason that led Aurangzeb to ban Diwali\\nwas the practice of gambling and drunken celebrations.[66] Truschke states that Aurangzeb did not\\nban private practices altogether and instead \"rescinded taxes previously levied on Hindu festivals\"\\nby his Mughal predecessors.[67] John Richards disagrees and states Aurangzeb, in his zeal to\\nrevive Islam and introduce strict Sharia in his empire, issued a series of edicts against Hindu\\nfestivals and shrines.[68] According to Richards, it was Akbar who abolished the discriminatory\\ntaxes on Hindu festivals and pilgrims, and it was Aurangzeb who reinstated the Mughal era\\ndiscriminatory taxes on festivals and increased other religion-based taxes.[68]\\nf. Some Muslims joined the Hindu community in celebrating Diwali in the Mughal era. Illustrative\\nIslamic records, states Stephen Blake, include those of 16th-century Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi who\\nwrote, \"during Diwali.... the ignorant ones amongst Muslims, particularly women, perform the\\nceremonies... they celebrate it like their own Id and send presents to their daughters and sisters,....\\nthey attach much importance and weight to this season [of Diwali].\"[66]\\ng. Williams Jones stated that the Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam is dedicated to Yama and ancestral\\nspirits, the Lacshmipuja dipanwita to goddess Lakshmi with invocations to Kubera, the Dyuta\\npratipat Belipuja to Shiva-Parvati and Bali legends, and the Bhratri dwitiya to Yama-Yamuna\\nlegend and the Hindus celebrate the brother-sister relationship on this day.[69] Jones also noted\\nthat on the Diwali day, the Hindus had a mock cremation ceremony with \"torches and flaming\\nbrands\" called Ulcadanam, where they said goodbye to their colleagues who had died in war or in\\na foreign country and had never returned home. The ceremony lit the path of the missing to the\\nmansion of Yama.[69]\\nh. Some inscriptions mention the festival of lights in Prakrit terms such as tipa-malai, sara-vilakku and\\nothers.\\ni. The Sanskrit inscription is in the Grantha script. It is well preserved on the north wall of the second\\nprakara in the Ranganatha temple, Srirangam island, Tamil Nadu.[75]\\nj. The Diwali-related inscription is the 4th inscription and it includes the year Vikrama Era 1268 (c.\\n1211 CE).[78]\\nk. Scholars contest the 527 BCE date and consider Mahavira\\'s biographical details as uncertain.\\nSome suggest he lived in the 5th-century BCE contemporaneously with the Buddha.[98][99]\\nl. Sikhs historically referred to this festival as Diwali. It was in early 20th-century, states Harjot Oberoi,\\na scholar of Sikh history, when the Khalsa Tract Society triggered by the Singh Sabha Movement\\nsought to establish a Sikh identity distinct from the Hindus and the Muslims.[107] They launched a\\nsustained campaign to discourage Sikhs from participating in Holi and Diwali, renaming the\\nfestivals, publishing the seasonal greeting cards in the Gurmukhi language and relinking their\\nreligious significance to Sikh historical events.[108] While some of these efforts have had a lasting\\nimpact for the Sikh community, the lighting, feasting together, social bonding, sharing and other\\nritual grammar of Sikh celebrations during the Diwali season are similar to those of the Hindus and\\nJains.[108]\\nm. Hindus of eastern and northeastern states of India associate the festival with the goddess Durga, or\\nher fierce avatar Kali (Shaktism).[84] According to McDermott, this region also celebrated the\\nLakshmi puja historically, while the Kali puja tradition started during the British Raj and was\\nparticularly prominent from the 1920s.[111]\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 16/34'), Document(metadata={'source': '/tmp/gradio/9f7810f43c85598e4a6abbbfa30dedff0f440ac3738fd2bba0b2a0bffba295cb/Diwali - Wikipedia.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='n. According to McDermott, while the Durga Puja is the largest Bengali festival and it can be traced to\\nthe 16th-century or earlier, the start of Kali puja tradition on Diwali is traceable to no earlier than\\nabout the mid-18th-century during the reign of Raja Krishnacandra Ray.[111] McDermott further\\nwrites that the older historic documents of the Bengal confirm that the Bengali Hindus have long\\ncelebrated the night of Diwali with illuminations, firecrackers, foods, new account books, Lakshmi\\n(not Kali), inviting their friends (including Europeans during the colonial era) and gambling.[111] The\\nKali sarbajanin tradition on Diwali, with tantric elements in some locations, grew slowly into a\\npopular Bengali tradition after the mid-1920s.[111]\\no. According to a Government of Himachal Pradesh and India publication, the Vishvakarma puja is\\nobserved on the fourth day of Diwali in the Himalayan state.[154]\\np. The Vishwakarma puja day is alternatively observed in other Hindu communities in accordance\\nwith the Hindu solar calendar, and this falls in September.[155]\\nq. Max Macauliffe, who lived in northwest Punjab area during the colonial era and is known for his\\nwork on Sikh literature and history, wrote about Diwali melas to which people visited to buy horses,\\nseek pleasure, pray in nearby Amritsar temples for the prosperity of their children and their souls,\\nand some on \"errands, more or less worthy or unworthy character\".[158]\\nr. A 2017 estimate states 50,000 tons (100 million pounds) of fireworks are exploded annually in India\\nover the Diwali festival.[168] As a comparison, Americans explode 134,000 tons (268 million\\npounds) of fireworks for 4 July celebrations in the United States.[169]\\ns. The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by\\nPope Paul VI. It began sending official greetings and message to Muslims in 1967 on Id al-Fitr.\\nAbout 30 years later, in the mid-1990s the Catholic authorities began sending two additional annual\\nofficial greetings and message, one to the Hindus on Diwali and the other to the Buddhists on\\nBuddha\\'s birthday.[174]\\nt. Diwali was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Diwali along with Holi for Hindus,\\nand Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan\\'s parliament in\\n2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and\\ngrant leave for its minority communities, for the first time.[184][185] Diwali celebrations have been\\nrelatively rare in contemporary Pakistan, but observed across religious lines, including by Muslims\\nin cities such as Peshawar.[186]\\n1.
