Hindu temples on this day\\nprepare and present \"mountains of sweets\" to the faithful who have gathered for darshan (visit).[148]\\nIn Gujarat, Annakut is the first day of the new year and celebrated through the purchase of essentials,\\nor sabras (literally, \"good things in life\"), such as salt, offering prayers to Krishna and visiting\\ntemples.[148] In Gujarat New Year is celebrated after the day of Diwali. In the early morning people\\ntake showers, do prayer at home, visit temples for worship and children in the evening visit\\nneighbour\\'s houses to say happy new year, shake hands, get mukhvas for dessert, and chocolate.\\nThe last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of\\nKartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally \"brother\\'s day\"[151]), Bhau Beej,\\nBhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta. It celebrates the sister-brother bond,\\nsimilar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels\\nto meet the sister and her family. This festive day is interpreted by\\nsome to symbolise Yama\\'s sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a\\ntilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister\\nSubhadra\\'s place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes\\nhim with a tilaka on his forehead.[148][152]\\nThe day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and sister.[153]\\nOn this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja\\nwith prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their brothers with\\ntheir hands and receiving gifts. According to Pintchman, in some Hindu traditions the women recite\\ntales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual\\nharm.[152] In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters,\\nor invite their sister\\'s family to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of\\nseasonal harvests.[42]\\nBhai Duj, Bhau-Beej, Vishwakarma Puja (Day 5)\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 12/34', 'A child playing with sparklers during\\nDiwali\\nOn the night of Diwali, rituals across much of India are dedicated\\nto Lakshmi to welcome her into their cleaned homes and bring\\nprosperity and happiness for the coming year.[140][62] While the\\ncleaning, or painting, of the home is in part for goddess Lakshmi, it\\nalso signifies the ritual \"reenactment of the cleansing, purifying\\naction of the monsoon rains\" that would have concluded in most of\\nthe Indian subcontinent.[140] Vaishnava families recite Hindu\\nlegends of the victory of good over evil and the return of hope after\\ndespair on the Diwali night, where the main characters may include\\nRama, Krishna, Vamana or one of the avatars of Vishnu, the divine\\nhusband of Lakshmi.[140][141] At dusk, lamps placed earlier in the\\ninside and outside of the home are lit up to welcome Lakshmi.[131]\\nFamily members light up firecrackers, which some interpret as a way to ward off all evil spirits and the\\ninauspicious, as well as add to the festive mood.[142][143] According to Pintchman, who quotes\\nRaghavan, this ritual may also be linked to the tradition in some communities of paying respect to\\nancestors. Earlier in the season\\'s fortnight, some welcome the souls of their ancestors to join the\\nfamily for the festivities with the Mahalaya. The Diwali night\\'s lights and firecrackers, in this\\ninterpretation, represent a celebratory and symbolic farewell to the departed ancestral souls.[144]\\nThe celebrations and rituals of the Jains and the Sikhs are similar to those of the Hindus where social\\nand community bonds are renewed. Major temples and homes are decorated with lights, festive foods\\nshared with all, friends and relatives remembered and visited with gifts.[133][97]\\nThe day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik.[145] It is regionally called Annakut\\n(heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and\\nother names.[27][145] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali\\'s defeat at\\nthe hands of Vishnu.[146][147] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati\\nand her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces,\\nParvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked.[145] According\\nto Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic\\nprocess for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as\\nrepresented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve\\nreflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar\\nmonth.[145]\\nThis day ritually celebrates the bond between the wife and husband,[148] and in some Hindu\\ncommunities, husbands will celebrate this with gifts to their wives. In other regions, parents invite a\\nnewly married daughter, or son, together with their spouses to a festive meal and give them gifts.[148]\\nIn some rural communities of the north, west and central regions, the fourth day is celebrated as\\nGovardhan puja, honouring the legend of the Hindu god Krishna saving the cowherd and farming\\ncommunities from incessant rains and floods triggered by Indra\\'s anger,[148] which he accomplished\\nby lifting the Govardhan mountain.

For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes,\\nor defiled souls of one\\'s ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife.[126] A\\nmythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by\\nKrishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura.[125] It is also\\ncelebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise,\\nwhile lighting a Diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun\\nritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities. Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of\\nspecial gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.\\nNaraka Chaturdashi is also a major day for purchasing festive foods, particularly sweets. A variety of\\nsweets are prepared using flour, semolina, rice, chickpea flour, dry fruit pieces powders or paste, milk\\nsolids (mawa or khoya) and clarified butter (ghee).[10] According to Goldstein, these are then shaped\\ninto various forms, such as laddus, barfis, halwa, kachoris, shrikhand, and sandesh, rolled and stuffed\\ndelicacies, such as karanji, shankarpali, maladu, susiyam, pottukadalai. Sometimes these are wrapped\\nwith edible silver foil (vark). Confectioners and shops create Diwali-themed decorative displays,\\nselling these in large quantities, which are stocked for home celebrations to welcome guests and as\\ngifts.[10][116] Families also prepare homemade delicacies for Lakshmi Pujan, regarded as the main day\\nof Diwali.[10] Chhoti Diwali is also a day for visiting friends, business associates and relatives, and\\nexchanging gifts.[116]\\nOn the second day of Diwali, Hanuman Puja is performed in some parts of India especially in Gujarat.\\nIt coincides with the day of Kali Chaudas. It is believed that spirits roam around on the night of Kali\\nChaudas, and Hanuman, who is the deity of strength, power, and protection, is worshipped to seek\\nprotection from the spirits. Diwali is also celebrated to mark the return of Rama to Ayodhya after\\ndefeating the demon-king Ravana[127] and completing his fourteen years of exile. The devotion and\\ndedication of Hanuman pleased Rama so much that he blessed Hanuman to be worshipped before\\nhim. Thus, people worship Hanuman the day before Diwali\\'s main day.[128]\\nThis day is commonly celebrated as Diwali in Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Karnataka. Traditionally, Marathi\\nHindus and South Indian Hindus receive an oil massage from the elders in the family on the day and\\nthen take a ritual bath, all before sunrise.[129] Many visit their favourite Hindu temple.[130]\\n11/1/24, 11:21 PM Diwali - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali 9/34'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata={'evolutions': ['Hypothetical'], 'synthetic_input_quality': 0.7}, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, source_file='/content/Diwali - Wikipedia.pdf')], conversational_goldens=[], _alias=None, _id=None)"

The event is marked by lights, decorations, and cultural festivities, fostering mutual appreciation and integration. In the US, Diwali's significance was formally recognized by Congress in 2007, with President Obama participating in White House celebrations in 2009, reflecting recognition and respect for cultural diversity.
